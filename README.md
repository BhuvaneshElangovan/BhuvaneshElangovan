## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**BhuvaneshElangovan/BhuvaneshElangovan** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

--> ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm [E.Bhuvanesh]!
- ðŸ”‹ Passionate about Electric Vehicles, MATLAB, and Simulink
-ðŸŽ“ Currently doing an EV course at Intellipaat
â€¢	Power Calculation for Vehicle Motor
â€¢	Energy Requirement Calculation for Electric Vehicle Journey
â€¢	Vehicle Fundamentals, Mechanical subsystems & Low voltage system.
â€¢	Graph plotting in Matlab
â€¢	Elementary Math (EV Battery Management), Trigonometry (Charging Station design), Linear Algebra (Powertrain Optimization), Interpolation (Range Estimation), Numerical Integration (Energy Consumption Analysis, Matrix and Pseudo Functions (Battery Management System Analysis), Polynomial (Motor Control Optimization)
â€¢	Introduction to Simulink Mathematical expression, Creating subsystems
â€¢	Simulink modelling by mathematical expression using constant, gain, ramp, step blocks
â€¢	Design a Simulink model to simulate EV battery charging dynamics by differential equation
â€¢	Design an electronic filter circuit for signal processing in an electric vehicle (EV) communication system. The circuit's dynamics are described by a second-order differential equation governing current flow.
â€¢	Faradayâ€™s Law, Lenzâ€™s Law, Self-inductance of solenoid, Mutual inductance of solenoid calculation
â€¢	calculating various parameters related to slip in induction machines, synchronous speed, power output of synchronous generators, losses in electric machines, and DC machine speed.
â€¢	Calculating of Motors and speed control method and various parameters.
â€¢	Calculation of BMS performance, reliability, efficiency
â€¢	Determine charging infrastructure key parameters such as real power (P), apparent power (S), and power factor (PF)  
â€¢	Autonomous Planning and Control Of EV
â€¢	Calculation of Tractive power and assigning of power required to the selection of EV motor by using Mat lab script and Simulink
